            <p class="story-paragraph">
              RentACar was founded in 2010 with a clear goal: to make car rental
              simple for everyone. We wanted to make renting a car easy,
              affordable, and enjoyable. What began as a small operation with
              just 10 vehicles has grown into one of the most trusted names in
              car rentals today.
            </p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">
              Today, we serve customers in more than 25 locations with a fleet
              of over 500 vehicles. Our vehicles range from economy cars to
              luxury SUVs. We have built our success on exceptional customer
              service, transparent pricing, and a strong commitment to quality.
              Our commitment to quality never changes.
            </p>

              We think driving should give you a sense of freedom and
              possibility. Maybe you're planning a family road trip, or need a
              reliable car for business travel, or want to enjoy the thrill of
              driving a luxury car. We're here to help you do just that.
